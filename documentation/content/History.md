# Bark's History

On December, 2023

Bark Coding started out as a simulation if  
[Scratch MIT](https://scratch.org) had a dog mascot.

AtomicBolts started Bark in his personal computer, with poor css

A web hosting was wanted at the time, Atomic didn't hear about [Nekoweb](https://nekoweb.org/) or [Neocities](https://neocities.org/) yet.

At last, Github was found and the [first commits](https://github.com/mariocraft987/bark-coding/commits/main/?after=90de7433c0df14563f3f145841f0bc53187a4bdd+2869) were made.

More coming soon...
